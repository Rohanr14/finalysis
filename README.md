# Finalysis

## Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive real-time financial data analysis tool that not only processes market data but also incorporates sentiment analysis from social media and news feeds, advanced prediction models, interactive visualizations, and real-time risk assessment. The tool leverages parallel computing for high-performance processing and offers unique insights by combining traditional financial data with alternative data sources.

## Key Features
1. **Real-time Market Data Fetching**: Uses APIs like Alpha Vantage to fetch market data.
2. **Sentiment Analysis Integration**: Analyzes sentiment from social media platforms to gauge market sentiment.
3. **Advanced Prediction Models**: Implements advanced models for more accurate market predictions.
4. **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides dynamic and interactive visualizations using web technologies.
5. **Real-time Risk Assessment**: Provides real-time risk metrics and alerts based on market data and sentiment analysis.
6. **User Customization**: Allows users to customize their analysis parameters and uses AI to provide personalized insights.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (g++ or equivalent)
- CMake
- Libraries: libcurl, JSON for Modern C++, Dlib (for machine learning), OpenMP
- API keys for financial and sentiment data (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Twitter API)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    git clone [<repository-url>](https://github.com/Rohanr14/finanlysis/)
    cd finalysis
    ```

2. **Create a build directory and navigate to it:**
    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. **Run CMake to generate build files:**
    ```sh
    cmake ..
    ```

4. **Build the project:**
    ```sh
    make
    ```

5. **Run the executable:**
    ```sh
    ./Finalysis
    ```

## Configuration

Update the `main.cpp` file with your API keys:
```cpp
int main() {
    std::string apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
    std::string symbol = "AAPL";
    std::string marketData = fetchData(apiKey, symbol);
    std::string sentimentData = fetchData("YOUR_SENTIMENT_API_KEY", "AAPL_SENTIMENT");

    auto processedMarketData = processData(marketData);
    auto sentimentScores = analyzeSentiment(sentimentData);
    
    auto trends = analyzeTrends(processedMarketData);
    auto risk = assessRisk(processedMarketData, sentimentScores);
    
    std::cout << "Real-time Risk Score: " << risk << std::endl;

    visualizeData(trends);

    return 0;
}
```

## Dependencies
Make sure to install the required dependencies before building the project:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev
For additional libraries like Dlib, you can follow their respective installation guides.
```

## Usage
After running the executable, the tool will fetch real-time market data and sentiment data, process it, analyze trends, assess risk, and visualize the results. Adjust parameters in the source code to customize the analysis according to your needs.
